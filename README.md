# How to VM in Arch Linux

This is my experience when trying to get Windows 11 VM with GPU Passthrough.

I will keep updating issues as I find, so far, I'm happy with the results.
I hope this helps people out there.
It is heavily reference by:

Most of the issues I had, I solved using google and GPT of course :)
Hopping you get something clear out of this.

Cheers,
